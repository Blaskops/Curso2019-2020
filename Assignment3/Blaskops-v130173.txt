         ?subject ?property ?object . }
limit 10


2. Get all the properties, except rdf:type, that can be applied to instances of the Politician class

PREFIX ns: <http://dbpedia.org/ontology/>

select distinct ?property where {
         ?subject a ns:Politician . 
         ?subject ?property ?object . 
         FILTER (?property != rdf:type) .

         ?subject a ns:Politician . 
         ?subject ?property ?object .
         FILTER (?property != rdf:type) .
}
group by ?property

5. For each of the properties, except rdf:type, that can be applied to instances of the Politician class, how many distinct values do they take in those instances?

PREFIX ns: <http://dbpedia.org/ontology/>
select distinct ?property (count(distinct ?object) as ?count) where {
         ?subject a ns:Politician . 
         ?subject ?property ?object .
